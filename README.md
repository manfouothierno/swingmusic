Swing Music is a beautiful, self-hosted music player for your local audio files. Like a cooler Spotify ... but bring your own music. Just run the app and enjoy your music library in a web browser.

### Installation

Swing Music is available as pre-compiled binaries for Windows and Linux. Just download the latest release from the [downloads page](https://swingmusic.vercel.app/downloads) and launch it.

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is needed for the audio silence skip feature, so you need to install it first. On windows, you can follows [this tutorial](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows) to install FFmpeg.

On Linux, you can install FFmpeg using:

```sh
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-extra -y
```

Then make the file executable first.

```bash
chmod a+x ./swingmusic

./swingmusic
```

The app should start at <http://localhost:1970> by default. Open it in your browser to use Swing Music. You can change the default port by using the `--port` flags.

```sh
swingmusic --port 1980
```

### Options

Options are flags that can be passed when starting the app in the terminal to tweak runtime settings or perform tasks. You can use the `-h` flag to see all supported options.

> [!TIP]
> You can read more about options in [the docs](https://swingmusic.vercel.app/guide/getting-started.html#options).

### Docker

Pull the latest Docker image and run it:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/swingmx/swingmusic:latest
```

```sh
docker run --name swingmusic -p 1970:1970 \
  -v /path/to/music:/music \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/swingmx/swingmusic:latest
```

Don't forget to replace `/path/to/music` and `/path/to/config` with the appropriate values. In addition, specify the the `/music` directory as the root directory. Using the `Home Directory` option won't work.

> [!TIP]
> For more info, see the [Docker section](https://swingmusic.vercel.app/guide/getting-started.html#docker) on the docs.

#### Using Docker Compose

Here's a sample Docker compose file:

```yaml
services:
  swingmusic:
    image: swingmusic
    container_name: swingmusic
    volumes:
      - /path/to/music:/music
      - /path/to/config:/config
    ports:
      - "1970:1970"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

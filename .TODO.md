# TODO
A list of things to do. Feel free to grab one of this and work on it.

## Clean up old playlist images
When playlists are deleted or their images updated, the old
images are not deleted.

Write a function to:
- read all images in the playlist image directory and checks unlinked images by comparing the list with the .image property of each property
- delete unlinked images

The function can run on app start up, before periodic checks
